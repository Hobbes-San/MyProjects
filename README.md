Fablix is a Tomcat database web application hosted on Amazon Web Services and written in Java/mySQL which allows customers to search and browse for movies by a variety of categories, add desired movies to the cart, and check out using their credit card information. It also allows employees to manually enter movies and stars into the database.

Attached as part of the project are XML files containing 61000+ data entries and Java files to parse the data into the mySQL database.

It also contains a secondary project FavorFlix, which is an Android application supporting a subset of features in the primary Fablix project.
